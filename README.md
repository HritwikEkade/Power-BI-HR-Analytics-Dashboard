# Human Resources Analytics Dashboard: Strategic Employee Churn & Satisfaction Analysis

## 💡 Project Overview
This Master's level business intelligence project focuses on resolving a critical challenge in Human Resources: **lack of predictive visibility into employee retention and job satisfaction drivers**. The deliverable is a dynamic, multi-page Power BI Dashboard designed to transform raw HR records into actionable business intelligence, empowering executive leadership to form data-driven retention strategies.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation & Key Features
This solution demonstrates expertise in the core pillars of advanced Power BI development:

* **Data Modeling:** Implementation of a foundational **Star Schema** (Fact and Dimension tables) to ensure model efficiency, scalability, and optimal query performance.
* **Advanced Data Transformation (Power Query M):** Sophisticated data preparation techniques, including conditional column creation, robust data type handling, and merging queries to establish a clean, analysis-ready dataset.
* **DAX Expertise:** Utilization of **complex time-intelligence functions** and **context transition** via `CALCULATE` to generate comparative metrics (e.g., Year-over-Year turnover rates, Department performance relative to total company average).
* **Visual Strategy:** Design focused on hierarchical navigation, starting with high-level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like Overall Turnover Rate and Average Satisfaction, leading to deep-dive pages for specific departmental and job role analysis.

## 🎯 Key Strategic Insight
The analysis successfully isolated **Job Role, Monthly Income, and Years at Company** as the three most critical, non-obvious factors correlating with employee attrition. This insight provides a direct, actionable pathway for HR to proactively target retention efforts, leading to a potential **reduction in recruitment and training costs**.
